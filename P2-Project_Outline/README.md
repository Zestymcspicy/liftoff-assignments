## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A friend of mine worked for a landscaping company. He suggested that there was a huge amount of time wasted because navigation apps get you to the location but don't direct you in such a way as to put you on the right side of the street.  He claimed that sometimes this wouldn't allow the crew to start working until the trailer got pulled up in front.  10 minutes here and there for a group of guys across the course of a week is hours in unnecessarily wasted labor.
An app that redirects by just a small amount could save time and labor for landscaping businesses.
